        These are two identical pictures side by side. The problem is, that we tend to percieve this as a one picture that should represent reality – two neighboring towers. By the rules of perspective, upper parts of towers (as “we are standing” quite close to the bases of the towers) are further away from us, and thus should look closer together. If they are not, our brain considers that there is something wrong with the tower. As we see, if tower on the left is already leaning to the right, than tower on the right should be leaning to the right even more.
