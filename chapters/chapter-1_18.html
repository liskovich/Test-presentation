        Most of how our perception works, and as a result, what we perceive is dependant on processes we do not have access to, and knowledge about. If not for unconscious micro motions of our eyes scanning scenes around us all the time, we would have a tunnel vision (try to stear at one point!), where everything is blurry except the tiny speck in the center of visual field. There are some internal laws of how these micro motions are executed. And there are some circumstances, when this system could be fooled. <a href="chapter-1_19.html">LOOK AT THIS</a>
