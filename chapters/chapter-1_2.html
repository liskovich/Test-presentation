        Despite that this realy is just a picture of a mug, the way how we perceive it, is quite amazing. Usually a concept of “a mug” just pops up in our consiouss mind (Where it comes from? Of corse, from unconsious part of our mind, and not directly from observable reality around us, nor the information, that our brain gets from the retina of our eyes! More on that in the chappter 4.). Concept of a mug is somewhat more complicated, that something observable as “white, shiny object”, or “something like a cilinder with an appendix”. It seems that our brain is trying to match observable reality with some list of predefined object categories we are familiar with. This is not like asking “what are the observable properties of an object, and based on these observations trying to figure out, what it could be?” Even if the object is distant and not easily discernible, that’s more laike “It should be something! Is this X, or maybe Y?” To prioritise options of significance and familiarity in the involuntary process of recognition, turns out to be a very succesful strategy. But, of corse, sometimes it skews our perception, as we are more biased towards the recognition of familiar types of objects.
