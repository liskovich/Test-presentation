        When we are given a clue, it is easy now to see a cow. But when You are given a clue, You can’t “unsee” a cow, to ever go back to the previous state of mind. There is a similarity with thinking bias called “curse of knowledge”. This is when you know things, that the other person does not, and you have forgotten what it’s like to not have this knowledge. Also somewhat relevant here could be a false sense of  predictability of events, that allready have happened, usually associated with expressions like: “I knew it all the way”!
