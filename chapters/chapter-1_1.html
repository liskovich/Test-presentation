    <title>Chapter 1. Perceptual illusions and naïve realism</title>
</head>

    <p>
        Just theoretically acknowledging, that sometimes we are wrong, doesn’t makes our thinking any better (Nice and simple intro to this problem by Kathryn Schulz, journalist who appoints herself to be a professional “wrongologist”: [Schulz, 2011]. Simple logic and scientific research in cognitive psychology upholds main statements made by her). There are a lot of known psyhological effects revieling, that our brain lulls us in to believing, that we are right no matter what. That everything always is ok with our way of percieving things and thinking about them, no matter what available evidence says. This could manifest in You believing that there is something special, something wrong with those pictures and tasks shown to You now, and, that there is nothing odd about yourself. When the truth is – there is nothing special about these pictures and tasks, but there are many things special about You (us – humans), which is beter to be familiar with.
